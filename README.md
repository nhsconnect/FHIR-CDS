## Clinical Decision Support API ##  
This Clinical Decision Support (CDS) RESTful FHIR STU3 'Read Only' API implementation guide supports the initiatives set out by the [UEC Digital Integration Programme](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/our-work/transforming-health-and-care-through-technology/urgent-and-emergency-care-domain-b/urgent-and-emergency-care-digital-integration).

The UEC Digital Integration Programme supports the delivery of the key recommendations and drivers for change that resulted from a number of NHS strategies, policies, frameworks and reviews, including the [National Information Board (NIB) Health and Care 2020 framework]( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personalised-health-and-care-2020), 
the [Urgent and Emergency Care Review](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trans-uec.pdf), and the [Five Year Forward View](https://www.england.nhs.uk/five-year-forward-view/). To achieve the transformation of Urgent and Emergency Care, patients must be directed to or connected with the right service to meet their needs and not be sent or conveyed to high end dispositions such as Accident and Emergency or GPs, unless absolutely necessary.  

## In Scope ##
This guide covers triage of patients by non-clinical staff and triage of patients by clinicians. This guide is intended for use by developers who are making systems compliant with the guide.

The Implementation Guide is based on initial discovery work, which informs the 1.0.0-alpha version of the Guide. The scope is expected to increase with more discovery work and as use cases are developed. Future versions of this Guide will include those updates as they are developed. Any resources not specifically mentioned in this Guide will follow the [HL7 FHIR STU3 guidance](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/index.html).

## Out of Scope ##
### Profiles and Value Sets ###
Profiles for the resources in this Implementation Guide are not included in the scope of 1.0.0-alpha. These are being developed and will be added to the Guide as they become available. As a result, value sets are also not part of the Guide in this version.
