## Evaluate ServiceDefinition Interaction ##
This is a [FHIR operation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/operations.html) performed by the Encounter Management System (EMS). 
It is an [evaluate operation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/servicedefinition-operations.html#evaluate) performed against the [Service Definition](http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/servicedefinition.html) resource to request clinical decision support guidance from a selected Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS).

The `$evaluate` operation in the context of the CDS API Implementation Guide is modelled as [UEC-Evaluate-Operation-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/OperationDefinition/UEC-Evaluate-Operation-1).

### Trigger for Evaluate ServiceDefinition Interaction ###  
The `ServiceDefinition.trigger` element is of datatype [TriggerDefinition](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/metadatatypes.html#TriggerDefinition) and this structure defines when a knowledge artifact, in this case a `ServiceDefinition`, is expected to be evaluated.  
Within the CDS implementation, the Data Event trigger type has been chosen. This means that the EMS's evaluation of a `ServiceDefinition` will be triggered in response to a data-related activity within an implementation, for example by an addition or an update of a record such as a `QuestionnaireResponse` resource.  
The triggering data of the event is described in the `trigger.eventData` element of the `ServiceDefinition` and this is populated by the CDSS.     

Note: It is the responsibility of the CDSS to ensure the triggering requirements have been met for this journey based on the assertions passed by the EMS.

## Request Headers ##
The following HTTP request headers are supported for this interaction:  


| Header               | Value |Conformance |
|----------------------|-------|-------|
| `Accept`      | The `Accept` header indicates the format of the response the client is able to understand, this will be one of the following `application/fhir+json` or `application/fhir+xml`. See the RESTful API [Content types](api_general_guidance.html#content-types) section. | MAY |
| `Authorization`      | The `Authorization` header MUST carry a base64url encoded JSON web token. See the RESTful API [Security](api_security.html) section. | MUST |  

## POST ServiceDefinition ##

The `ServiceDefinition.$evaluate` operation is performed by an HTTP POST command as shown:  

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
POST [base]/ServiceDefinition/[id]/$evaluate</div>  

## Parameters ##
The `ServiceDefinition.$evaluate` operation has a number of parameters and the EMS will select appropriate IN parameters to include in the operation. 
The CDSS will return a `GuidanceResponse` resource as the OUT parameter of the operation.

## ServiceDefinition $evaluate parameters of note ##
Parameters passed in the `ServiceDefinition.$evaluate` operation of particular significance to implementers are noted below:  

### encounter element ###
This element carries reference to the encounter currently in context for the triage. It is the responsibility of the EMS to identify the correct encounter in each `$evaluate` interaction with the CDSS to reduce the risk of inappropriate triage.

### inputData element ###
This element carries the triage journey data for the decision. The EMS will populate this element with all assertions collected in a particular triage journey and any other assertions considered to be of relevance.
The CDSS is obliged to consider anything carried in the `ServiceDefinition.dataRequirement` element, but can ignore resources posted in inputData which are not in the `dataRequirement` element.
In particular, where there are ‘branching’ or bundled `ServiceDefinitions` within a single journey, the last `ServiceDefinition` will have all assertions passed in inputData from prior ServiceDefinitions.
This may or may not affect the population of the result element in `GuidanceResponse` created by the CDSS.

### patient element ###

It should be noted that within a number of triage scenarios it may not be possible to accurately establish the identity of a patient. In some cases it may be possible to establish their identity, but only at a later stage in their triage.

Some scenarios where this might apply:

- when dealing with an unconscious patient
- when a patient does not wish to disclose their identity
- during an online journey for a system does not establish identity/ only establishes identity later in the journey

In these types of scenario the EMS MUST still populate the Patient resource (.subject).  The Patient resource will be populated as appropriate for the EMS.  This may be generating a temporary patient identifier, suitably identified, with appropriate information for an unidentified patient.

The manner in which an EMS uses anonymous and interim identifiers is outside the scope of this Implementation Guide.

### userType element ###
The userType element carries the type of user initiating the request to the CDSS. It MUST be populated by the EMS and can have the values Patient, RelatedPerson, or Practitioner.


## Response from CDSS ##

### Success ###

* MUST return a <code class="highlighter-rouge">200</code> **OK** HTTP status code on successful execution of the operation.
* MUST return a <code class="highlighter-rouge">GuidanceResponse</code> resource.
