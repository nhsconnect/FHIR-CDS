## Evaluate Response ##

The [GuidanceResponse](http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/guidanceresponse.html) is the synchronous response generated by the Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS). It is returned by the CDSS in response to the EMS’s `ServiceDefinition.$evaluate` operation.
It carries the status of the response, any warnings or messages returned by the service, as well as the output data of the module and the result in the form of any suggested actions to be performed.

View the [CDS implementation guidance for a GuidanceResponse](api_guidance_response.html).


## Result interaction ##

Any triage interaction undertaken by a user needs to end by providing an appropriate recommendation as to what action to perform next. To facilitate the above user outcomes each `ServiceDefinition` should in turn end in either:

- Care advice,
- A referral to a service, or
- Redirection to a more appropriate `ServicieDefinition` based on the responses entered by the user

For example, a user might initially answer questions related to a `ServiceDefinition` for a rash. If their responses suggested potential meningitis, the system should have the ability to switch to a `ServiceDefinition` relating to meningitis so that an appropriate triage can be completed.

A `ServiceDefinition` may need to be capable of redirecting to multiple other `ServiceDefinitions`. For example, dependent on what answers are provided a `ServiceDefinition` relating to headache might need to redirect to `ServiceDefinitions` such as migraine, head injury or stroke. 

Given that a `ServiceDefinition` may redirect to other appropriate `ServiceDefinitions` there is potential for:

- A circular user journey, i.e. the user being asked questions that have already been answered earlier in the journey
- An unintended loop within the system, where `ServiceDefinitions` directly or indirectly redirect to each other

The possibility of this occurring will be based on the CDSS triage logic. Deploying organisations should configure their solution to prevent being directed back to a previous `ServiceDefinition` unintentionally.

It is recommended that testing is undertaken to ensure a given solution can prevent unintentional looping.


## Request Headers ##
The following HTTP request headers are supported for this interaction:  


| Header               | Value |Conformance |
|----------------------|-------|-------|
| `Accept`      | The `Accept` header indicates the format of the response the client is able to understand, this will be one of the following `application/fhir+json` or `application/fhir+xml`. See the RESTful API [Content types](api_general_guidance.html#content-types) section. | MAY |
| `Authorization`      | The `Authorization` header MUST carry a base64url encoded JSON web token. See the RESTful API [Security](api_security.html) section. | MAY |


## Key Aspects of the Return GuidanceResponse Interaction ##
Key aspects of this interaction which are of particular significance to implementers are noted below:  

### Outcome of the Triage Journey ###
This is carried in the `result` element of the `GuidanceResponse`. The outcome of the triage journey is displayed to the user by the EMS.  

There are three main outcomes for a triage journey and these are outlined below:-  

#### 1. Triage referral ####

A recommendation as to where the patient should go next; the `result` element in `GuidanceResponse` MUST be populated with a `RequestGroup` resource which will reference a `ReferralRequest`.  

The details of the referral carried in the `ReferralRequest` may be displayed to the user by the EMS.
This referral may be also used to drive a directory search within the EMS to locate a specific provider, location or service for a patient. 
<!-- Please note that guidance on how to perform this type of directory search is out of scope of this Implementation Guide. -->

View [CDS implementation guidance for a ReferralRequest](api_evaluate_referral_request.html)  

#### 2. Care Advice ####

Care advice for the patient (or third party) on actions that can be performed now to either assist the patient, or to assist the triage process.

- More than one piece of care advicecare plan may be appropriate for a given triage, for example in a scenario where a patient has multiple injuries requiring care
- The result element in `GuidanceResponse` MUST be populated with a RequestGroup resource which will reference at least one CarePlan, and may optionally reference a ReferralRequest
- Any care advice carried in the one or more CarePlan resources MUST be displayed to the user by the EMS.
	
View [CDS implementation guidance for a CarePlan](api_care_plan.html)  

#### 3. Redirection of the Service Definition ####

A recommendation to redirect to a different `ServiceDefinition`; the `result` element in `GuidanceResponse` SHOULD NOT be populated. Additionally, the [GuidanceResponse.dataRequirement](api_guidance_response.html#re-direction-to-a-new-servicedefinition) element will be used to carry a description of the data required by the EMS to enable it to select the new `ServiceDefinition` as directed by the CDSS.  
  
View [CDS implementation guidance for a GuidanceResponse](api_guidance_response.html)    
  
The final result or outcome of a triage journey will be available only when the `GuidanceResponse.status` is set to 'success'.  

### Status of the returned GuidanceResponse ###

The status of the `GuidanceResponse` is a trigger for the Encounter Management System (EMS). It MUST contain one of the following values: 

<table style="min-width:100%;width:100%">
<tr>
    <th style="width:25%;">Code</th>
    <th style="width:25%;">Display</th>
    <th style="width:50%;">Definition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">success</code></td>
      <td>Success</td>
    <td>The request was processed successfully</td>
 </tr>
<tr>
    <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">data-requested</code></td>
      <td>Data Requested</td>
    <td>The request was processed successfully, but more data may result in a more complete evaluation</td>
 </tr>
<tr>
    <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">data-required</code></td>
      <td>Data Required</td>
    <td>The request was processed, but more data is required to complete the evaluation</td>
 </tr>
</table>

#### Status of success ####
This means that the result is ready and no further `Questionnaires` are posted in the `GuidanceResponse`.  
The CDSS has all information possible for the `ServiceDefinition` to which the `GuidanceResponse` is responding and has provided a result.  
If the CDSS is recommending a referral to another service, the `GuidanceResponse.result` element will reference a `RequestGroup` which will in turn reference a `ReferralRequest` with a `status` of active. This referral may be accompanied by care advice (not self-care) and/or information about a procedure which the recommended service is expected to provide.  
If the CDSS is recommending care advice for a patient, the `result` element will reference a `RequestGroup` which will reference a `CarePlan` with a `status` of active.  
Alternatively, the `result` element will be null and the `GuidanceResponse.dataRequirement` element will be used to carry a description of the data required by the EMS to enable it to select the new `ServiceDefinition` as directed by the CDSS.  

The table below gives additional information relating to outcome scenarios when the `status` element of the `GuidanceResponse` is set to 'success':

    <td>success</td>
    <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">GuidanceResponse.result</code> is null and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">GuidanceResponse.dataRequirement</code> element will be used to carry a description of the data required by the EMS to enable it to select the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">ServiceDefinition</code>.</td>
    <td></td>
</tr>
</table>  
 
#### Status of data-requested ####
This means that the CDSS has sufficient information to render a result, but additional information will provide a better result. There are additional `Questionnaire` resources in the `GuidanceResponse` which SHOULD be answered.  
The `result` element in `GuidanceResponse` MUST be populated with a `RequestGroup` resource.  
If the CDSS is recommending an interim or initial recommendation relating to a referral to another service, the `RequestGroup` will reference a `ReferralRequest` in draft status.  
Care advice may additionally be given alongside this interim referral recommendation. If the CDSS is additionally recommending care advice (not self-care), the `ReferralRequest` will also reference a `CarePlan` in draft status.  
If the CDSS is recommending an interim or initial recommendation relating to care advice for the patient (self-care), the `RequestGroup` will reference a `CarePlan` in draft status.  
The `dataRequirement` element in `GuidanceResponse` MUST be populated with at least one `Questionnaire`.  

The table below gives additional information relating to outcome scenarios when the `status` element of the `GuidanceResponse` is set to 'data-requested':  


<table style="min-width:100%;width:100%">

<tr>
  <td>The CDSS has sufficient information to make a recommendation regarding what service the patient should use next and there is also a recommendation relating to a care plan (not self-care).</td>
    <td>data-requested</td>
    <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">GuidanceResponse</code> references <code class="highlighter-rouge">RequestGroup</code> which references <code class="highlighter-rouge">ReferralRequest</code> which in turn references <code class="highlighter-rouge">CarePlan</code>.</td>

</tr>
</table>

#### Status of data-required ####
This means that the CDSS has insufficient information to render an outcome.  There are additional `Questionnaire(s)` in the `GuidanceResponse` which MUST be answered.  
The `result` element in `GuidanceResponse` MAY be populated with a `RequestGroup`, for example referencing one or more `CarePlans` or one `ReferralRequest`.  
The CDSS can make a referral during the triage journey, and also wish to continue the triage process.  This is referred to as an inline referral, and is commonly done for Ambulance Despatch.  
This can be represented by setting `GuidanceResponse.status` to 'data-required', but populating the `result` element with a `ReferralRequest` resource with a `status` of 'active'.  Care advice can be given with this inline referral (not self-care).
The CDSS can also recommend inline care advice (self care).
The `dataRequirement` element in `GuidanceResponse` MUST be populated with at least one `Questionnaire`.  

The table below gives additional information relating to outcome scenarios when the `status` element of the `GuidanceResponse` is set to 'data-required':  


<table style="min-width:100%;width:100%">

<tr>
    <th style="width:35%;">Result</th>
    <th style="width:10%;">Status of the GuidanceResponse</th>

	<td><code class="highlighter-rouge">GuidanceResponse</code> references <code class="highlighter-rouge">RequestGroup</code> which references a <code class="highlighter-rouge">CarePlan</code>.</td>
    <td>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">CarePlan</code> will have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">status</code> of 'active'.</td>    
</tr>
</table>

### OutputParameters of the returned GuidanceResponse ###  
As users input answers to triage questions, the EMS will relay them to the CDSS within the `QuestionnaireResponse` element.

In response the CDSS will generate assertions, which will be captured in the `GuidanceResponse.outputParameters` element. Within this element, the CDSS MUST also return the `QuestionnaireResponse` resources originally populated by the EMS.  Not all `QuestionnaireResponses` will generate assertions, but any `QuestionnaireResponse` which can generate an assertion MUST generate an assertion.
